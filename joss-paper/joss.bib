In the past few years, emerging technologies derived largely from the Human Genome Project have been applied to evaluating the intestinal microbiota and new discoveries using these techniques have prompted new initiatives such as the Human Microbiome Roadmap designed to evaluate the role of the intestinal microbiome in health and disease. In this review, we wish to focus on some new developments in this area and discuss some of the effects of medical manipulations such as antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics and C-section versus vaginal delivery on the intestinal microbiota.},

It is shown to outperform all other known community detection methods in terms of computation time. Moreover, the quality of the communities detected is very good, as measured by the so-called modularity. This is shown first by identifying language communities in a Belgian mobile phone network of 2 million customers and by analysing a web graph of 118 million nodes and more than one billion links. The accuracy of our algorithm is also verified on ad hoc modular networks.}

	abstract={The community structure of complex networks reveals both their organization and hidden relationships among their constituents. Most community detection methods currently available are not deterministic and their results typically depend on the specific random seeds, initial conditions and tie-break rules adopted for their execution. Consensus clustering is used in data analysis to generate stable results out of a set of partitions delivered by stochastic methods. Here we show that consensus clustering can be combined with any existing method in a self-consistent way, enhancing considerably both the stability and the accuracy of the resulting partitions. This framework is also particularly suitable to monitor the evolution of community structure in temporal networks. An application of consensus clustering to a large citation network of physics papers demonstrates its capability to keep track of the birth, death and diversification of topics.},
